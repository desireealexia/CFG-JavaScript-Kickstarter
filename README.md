# JavaScript Kickstarter Course – Code First Girls

This repository contains my work from the CFG JavaScript Kickstarter course. This beginner-friendly course covered the core fundamentals of JavaScript and its role in web development. It included both foundational exercises and practical projects to build real-world coding confidence.

## 📚 Course Overview

The course consisted of eight modules covering the following topics:

1. **Hello, World!** - Setting up and writing your first lines of JavaScript  
2. **Data Types and Variables** – Understanding how to store and work with data  
3. **Comparisons** – Writing conditional logic using comparison operators  
4. **Loops and Functions** – Repeating actions and creating reusable code blocks  
5. **Web Development (1)** – Introducing JavaScript in the browser  
6. **Web Development (2)** – Enhancing interactivity and manipulating the DOM  
7. **Recap** – Reviewing core concepts and project ideas  
8. **Reflection and Next Steps** – Looking back and planning the learning journey ahead

## 🛠️ Projects

Throughout the course, I completed interactive mini-exercises and browser-based challenges related to the fictional grocery store. While there is no standalone final project, the module exercises collectively demonstrate applied knowledge across topics like conditionals, loops, functions, and DOM manipulation.

## 🚀 How to Run

To explore the browser-based exercises:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/desireealexia/CFG-JavaScript-Kickstarter.git
   ```

2. Open the HTML files located in the `Module-Exercises/module5/` or `module6/` folders in your browser. For JavaScript-only files, open them in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code) or run them using the browser console or Node.js.

## 💬 Reflections

This course helped strengthen my core JavaScript skills and gave me confidence in writing clean, functional code. It laid a strong foundation for advancing into more complex topics like API integration and React.
